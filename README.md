# alex-packet-id-finder

lists opcode candidates after their triggering based on their definitions (that means you must have **correct** .def file for it)

## Added
### Filter multiple definitions
You can also find all opcodes listed in a json file. Just put all definitions in a json file and use command `fpi file filename`.
See the example file defs-example.json, you can try it using `fpi file defs-example`.

### Log to file
For better filtering multiple definitions, opcode candidates are also logged to a file `fpi-log` inside proxy folder.

## Usage (proxy command)
### `fpi`

### `fpi file `
